# ðŸ§  Radiomics Analysis of DAT SPECT Imaging in Parkinson's Disease  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a **neurodegenerative disorder** with no definitive cure. Current treatments primarily focus on symptom management. **Molecular imaging techniques**, such as **Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)**, provide valuable insights into neurochemical alterations, aiding in PD diagnosis and research.  

This study explores the **validity of using Dopamine Transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging** for Parkinsonâ€™s disease by extracting **radiomic features** and applying statistical and machine learning techniques for classification and feature selection.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
âœ… Analyze **53 subjects** (33 PD patients, 20 healthy controls).  
âœ… Extract **178 radiomic features** from **DAT SPECT** imaging.  
âœ… Identify statistically significant features for distinguishing PD patients from controls (**p < 0.05**).  
âœ… Reduce dataset dimensionality using **LASSO regression** and remove redundant variables.  
âœ… Construct a **Radiomics score** to enhance classification accuracy (**p < 0.005**).  
âœ… Apply **machine learning models** to classify healthy vs. PD subjects.  
âœ… Investigate correlations between radiomic features and **clinical symptom severity**.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools  
- **MATLAB** â€“ Feature extraction and statistical analysis.  
- **RStudio** â€“ Machine learning classification and regression models.  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
ðŸ”¹ A **consistent set of radiomic features** was identified, significantly differentiating PD patients from healthy controls.  
ðŸ”¹ A **Radiomics score** was developed, showing **strong statistical significance** in classification.  
ðŸ”¹ **Machine learning models** achieved promising results in subject classification.  
ðŸ”¹ **Highest feature correlations** were observed with **morphology and histogram intensity-based features**.  
ðŸ”¹ Despite dataset limitations, the study highlights the **potential of DAT SPECT radiomics as a PD biomarker**.
