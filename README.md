# Radiomics Analysis of DAT SPECT Imaging in Parkinson's Disease  

## Overview  
This project investigates the use of radiomics for analyzing **DAT SPECT imaging** as a biomarker for **Parkinson's Disease**. The study aims to determine whether radiomic features extracted from SPECT scans can provide meaningful insights into disease progression and diagnosis.  

The project was developed in collaboration with **Università degli Studi di Padova** as part of a group research effort.  

## Objectives  
- Extract radiomic features from **DAT SPECT** imaging.  
- Assess the potential of these features as biomarkers for **Parkinson’s Disease**.  
- Compare and validate results using statistical and machine learning approaches.  

## Technologies & Tools  
- **MATLAB** – Data analysis feature extraction.  
- **RStudio** – machine learning classification.  

## Results  
The study provides a justified opinion on the effectiveness of **radiomics in DAT SPECT analysis** for Parkinson’s Disease. The results highlight potential biomarkers that could assist in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.
